# A dark user style for Phabricator

Simple style for the userstyles extension that enables a "dark mode" that
does not kill your eyes with the way-too-bright default look'n'feel.

You need the userstyles.org extension for Firefox in order to use this style
and possibly to adapt the document matching rule if you're using a Phabricator
under your custom domain. It might work on Chrome too, but I haven't tested it.
